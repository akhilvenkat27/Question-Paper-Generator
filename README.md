# Question-Paper-Generator  

- Qp Generator mainly works for designing their exam-oriented question paper online without typing all the questions manually.  
- In simple terms for each subject we have incorporated a set of questions in the database, if needed we can add more questions based on requirements & customizations.  
- This simplifies for the faculty without manually typing all the questions while preparing the question paper.   
- Faculty enters into our application and selects the subject, on one click they will select required questions as per marks they can also edit the question as they wish, and then by simply clicking the question paper is generated & ready to print.  
- This type of mechanism is first for institutions/schools.  
Stakeholders:  
- Colleges, Schools, or any other institutions.  
Upcoming Features:  
- Generating questions using AI.
